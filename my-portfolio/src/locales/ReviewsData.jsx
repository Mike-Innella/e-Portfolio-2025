      I had the opportunity to work closely with Mike while leading a recent web project. He played a key role in helping build out the site and consistently delivered quality work. He was dependable, quick to pick up new tasks, and asked the right questions to keep things moving smoothly. His attention to detail and willingness to iterate on feedback made him a valuable part of the team.

      I have worked side by side with Mike on a few projects now. It’s always such a fun and creative process working with him. Not only does he play well with others, but his performance and turnaround times for project completion are unmatched! Mike has hand-crafted some beautiful and unique designs with expert functionality.

      I’m looking forward to working with him again in the very near future. Thanks, Mike!
